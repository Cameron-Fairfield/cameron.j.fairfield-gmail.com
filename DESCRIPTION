Description: ukbcodes takes an input of exisiting codes for a condition and returns suggestions in another code set.
    Currently it is possible to suggest READ codes (V2 or V3) based on ICD9, ICD10 or OPCS4 codes.
    It is also possible to suggest ICD9 or ICD10 codes based on READ codes or ICD9/10 codes.
    Each suggestion is accompanied by a basic text description of the code as supplied by the UK Biobank.
    Other mappings (e.g. OPCS4 to ICD, ICD to OPCS4, READ to OPCS4, READ V3 to READ V2 or any OPCS3 codes) are not currently supported.
